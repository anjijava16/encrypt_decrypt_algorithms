# GCP Default algorithms
1. AES 256 & AES 128 ---> Encruption(GCP By default in GCP Platform)
2. Elliptic curve cryptography ---> Storng encrpption alogrthm
3. Data Encryption Standards(DES) ---> Easily broken by today's method
4. BlowFish ---> Designed as a replacement for DES and other weak encryption algorithms
